# calcheck
A calendar checking system.

calcheck is aimed to be a system that is ablee to check various web-calendars such as Google Calendar, Eventbrite, and Facebook, to let you know in a simple UI whether you are free or not for an event.

It is an idea grown out of [this tweet thread](https://twitter.com/Samathy_Barratt/status/828225589240803329), and will hopefully be worked on by @aimeec110 and @samathy
